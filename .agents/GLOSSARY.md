# DevTools

Developer tooling monorepo providing development utilities and workflows across CLI, daemon, API, and frontend interfaces.

## Language

**Daemon**:
The single production Bun process that serves compiled frontend static assets and routes API requests in-process on a single port.

**Runtime Stack**:
The interconnected pipeline linking CLI commands, local daemon, Hono API routes, and Next.js static frontend.

**Slice Boundary**:
The explicit encapsulation boundary (`index.ts`) of an architectural slice, exposing only its root entry point.

**Spec**:
A high-level capability specification tracking a milestone or major feature. Contains child tickets and holds the release milestone.

**Ticket**:
An atomic vertical slice delivering end-to-end functionality across schema, logic, UI, and tests for a parent Spec. Does not hold a milestone.

**Frontier**:
The set of open tickets whose blocking dependencies are resolved and are ready for immediate pickup.

**Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)**:
The single human or agent holding atomic execution responsibility for an issue.

**One-Way Door**:
An architectural decision or change that has high reversal cost.

**Two-Way Door**:
A reversible change that can be walked back with minimal cost or risk.

**Artifact**:
A working document, report, or visual preview generated during execution and stored in `tmp/`.

**Ephemeral File**:
A temporary working file (debug script, raw spike, diff) living strictly in the gitignored `tmp/` directory.

**Handoff**:
A structured transition document recording settled decisions, active blockers, and the next frontier in `tmp/handoff/`.

**Research Spike**:
A time-boxed investigation of primary sources in `tmp/research/` that terminates by recording a decision in an ADR.

**Workspace Root**:
The top-level project container holding repository-wide developer tooling, formatting, and the shared TypeScript compiler.

**Leaf Workspace**:
An isolated application (`apps/*`) or shared library package (`packages/*`) with its own package manifest and boundary.

**Direct Dependency**:
A package declared explicitly in a workspace's own `package.json`.

**Phantom Dependency**:
An undeclared package imported inside a workspace that resolves only through parent or sibling hoisting.

**Shared Core**:
The `@devtools/core` package providing domain schemas, types, and error definitions used across multiple packages.

**Release PR**:
The automated candidate pull request maintained on `main` by Release Please that aggregates Conventional Commits into changelog and version updates until merged by a maintainer.

**Standalone Executable**:
A self-contained, single-file binary produced by `bun build --compile` embedding the Bun runtime engine, entrypoint bytecode, and dependencies for a specific target operating system and architecture.

**Checksum Manifest**:
The cryptographic verification file (`SHA256SUMS.txt`) documenting SHA256 hashes of all compiled standalone executables attached to a GitHub release.

**Code Owner**:
The designated maintainer account (`@AhmedHanye`) holding mandatory review responsibility across the repository, declared via `.github/CODEOWNERS` and enforced via repository rulesets.

**Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR)**:
The confidential disclosure channel within GitHub Security Advisories enabling researchers to submit vulnerability reports under a 48-hour triage SLA without public disclosure.

**Fork Security Boundary**:
The repository perimeter protection enforced via GitHub Branch Rulesets and mandatory Code Owner review (`@AhmedHanye`) ensuring external fork pull requests cannot modify protected workflows, toolchain manifests, or agent instruction files without explicit maintainer approval.

**Branch Ruleset**:
The repository policy configuration on `main` enforcing required CI status checks, linear squash merges, and Code Owner review gates with maintainer bypass authorization.

**Vendor Skill**:
An external capability package declared in `skills-lock.json` whose upstream instructions may be superseded by repository-specific execution boundaries.

**Review Thread Resolution**:
The pull request state invariant enforced by repository rulesets requiring all reviewer and bot comment conversations to be explicitly marked resolved before merge eligibility.

**Evaluation Verdict**:
The conclusive status (`MERGE` or `INVESTIGATE`) assigned to a pull request denoting its eligibility for squash merging into `main`.
