# Runtime & CLI Context

Domain terms for the DevTools runtime stack, local daemon, and standalone executable distribution.

## Language

**Daemon**:
The single production Bun process that serves compiled frontend static assets and routes API requests in-process on a single port.

**Runtime Stack**:
The interconnected pipeline linking CLI commands, local daemon, Hono API routes, and Next.js static frontend.

_Avoid_: Common library, shared utils, base package

**Standalone Executable**:
A self-contained single-file binary produced by `bun build --compile` embedding the Bun engine, entrypoint bytecode, and dependencies.
_Avoid_: Native binary, compiled bundle, distribution build

**Checksum Manifest**:
The cryptographic verification file (`SHA256SUMS.txt`) documenting SHA256 hashes of compiled standalone executables attached to a GitHub release.
_Avoid_: Hash list, verification file, signature manifest
